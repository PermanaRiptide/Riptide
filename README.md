# Riptide
##From Wikipedia:  
Rip tide or riptide, also known as an ebb jet or tidal jet, is a strong tidal flow of water within estuaries and other enclosed tidal areas.[1] The term "rip tide" or "riptide" is often incorrectly applied to rip currents, which are not tidal flows.  
A common misnomer for a rip current, a fast narrow current running offshore and cutting through breaking waves.
